High-quality documentation is essential for the success of the Glueful framework. This guide explains how to contribute to Glueful's documentation effectively.

## Documentation Structure

The Glueful documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. **Getting Started**: Introduction, installation guides, and quick start tutorials
2. **Core**: Core concepts, architecture, and essential components
3. **Advanced Features**: More complex usage patterns and sophisticated capabilities
4. **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and security best practices
5. **Database**: Database integration, migrations, and query patterns
6. **Extensions**: Information about the extension system and official extensions
7. **Community**: Contributing guidelines and community resources (this section)

## Writing Style Guidelines

When contributing to the documentation, please follow these style guidelines:

- **Clear and concise language**: Prefer short sentences and simple explanations
- **Present tense**: Write "This method returns..." rather than "This method will return..."
- **Active voice**: Use "Click the button" rather than "The button should be clicked"
- **Inclusive language**: Avoid assumptions about the reader's background or identity
- **Practical examples**: Include real-world examples that solve common use cases
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start with basic concepts before introducing advanced topics
- **Proper headings**: Use a logical hierarchy of headings (H1 > H2 > H3)
- **Internal linking**: Link to related documentation to help users navigate

## Adding New Documentation

### File Structure

Documentation files are Markdown files (`.md`) located in the `/docs/src/content/` directory. Each section has its own numbered directory (e.g., `1.getting-started/`), and files within the directory are also numbered for proper ordering.

Example file path: `/docs/src/content/2.core/3.routing.md`

### Front Matter

Each documentation page should include front matter at the top of the file:

```md
---
title: Page Title
description: Brief description of the page content (appears in search results)
navigation:
  icon: i-lucide-icon-name
---

# Page Title

Content goes here...
```

The `icon` field uses [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/), with the `i-lucide-` prefix.

### Navigation

The navigation for each section is defined in a `.navigation.yml` file in the section directory:

```yaml
title: Section Title
description: Brief section description
icon: i-lucide-icon-name
links:
  - label: Page Title
    to: /section-path/page-slug
  - label: Another Page
    to: /section-path/another-page
    collapsed: true
    children:
      - label: Child Page
        to: /section-path/child-page
```

## Documentation Formatting

Glueful documentation uses an extended Markdown syntax with several enhancements.

### Code Blocks

Use triple backticks with a language specifier for syntax highlighting:

````md
```php
<?php

namespace Glueful\Services;

class AuthenticationService
{
    public function authenticate(string $username, string $password): ?User
    {
        // Implementation...
    }
}
```
````

For code blocks with filenames, use a comment at the top:

````md
```php
// filename: api/Services/AuthenticationService.php
<?php

namespace Glueful\Services;

class AuthenticationService
{
    // ...
}
```
````

### Callouts

The Glueful documentation supports special callout blocks using a custom syntax:

```md
::callout{type="info" icon="i-lucide-info"}
This is an important information callout.
::

::callout{type="warning" icon="i-lucide-alert-triangle"}
This is a warning callout to highlight potential issues.
::

::callout{type="danger" icon="i-lucide-alert-octagon"}
This is a danger/error message for critical information.
::

::callout{type="tip" icon="i-lucide-lightbulb"}
This is a tip or best practice suggestion.
::
```

### Tabs

You can create tabbed content using:

```md
::tabs
:::tab{title="PHP"}
```php
// PHP code example
```
:::
:::tab{title="JavaScript"}
```js
// JavaScript code example
```
:::
::
```

### Tables

Use standard Markdown tables:

```md
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

### Images

When adding images to the documentation:

1. Place image files in `/docs/public/images/` 
2. Use a descriptive filename that indicates its content
3. Add appropriate alt text for accessibility
4. Consider both light and dark themes if applicable

```md
![Alt text describing the image](/images/feature-diagram.png)
```

For theme-specific images:

```md
![Alt text describing the image](/images/light/feature-diagram.png) <!-- Light mode image -->
![Alt text describing the image](/images/dark/feature-diagram.png) <!-- Dark mode image -->
```

## API Documentation

When documenting API endpoints:

1. Use consistent formatting for all endpoints
2. Include request and response examples
3. Document parameters, headers, and authentication requirements
4. Provide error codes and their explanations

Example API endpoint documentation:

````md
### Get User

```
GET /api/v1/users/{id}
```

Retrieves a user by their ID.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | string | The user ID |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "user-123",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com"
}
```

**Status Codes:**

- `200 OK`: Successful operation
- `404 Not Found`: User not found
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required
````

## Testing Documentation Changes

After making changes to the documentation, you should:

1. Run the documentation site locally to verify your changes

   ```bash
   cd docs
   pnpm install  # First time only
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Check for broken links and formatting issues
3. Test on different screen sizes for responsiveness
4. Verify that code examples work as expected
5. Proofread carefully for typos and grammatical errors

## Submitting Documentation Changes

Follow the same [Pull Request process](/community/pull-requests) as code contributions, with these additional guidelines:

1. For small fixes (typos, clarifications), you can submit a PR directly
2. For larger changes (new pages, restructuring), create an issue first to discuss
3. Use the branch prefix `docs/` for documentation changes
4. Include screenshots of before/after if you're making visual changes

## Documentation Best Practices

1. **Keep it updated**: Ensure documentation stays in sync with the latest code
2. **Be comprehensive**: Cover both basic and advanced use cases
3. **Include troubleshooting**: Add common errors and their solutions
4. **Use progressive disclosure**: Start simple, then introduce complexity
5. **Focus on user tasks**: Organize by what users want to accomplish
6. **Cross-reference**: Link related documentation sections
7. **Use consistent terminology**: Don't switch between different terms for the same concept

## Translation Contributions

If you're interested in translating the Glueful documentation to other languages:

1. Contact the core team via Discord or the forum
2. Translation workflows and tooling will be provided
3. Focus on translating the core documentation first before moving to advanced topics
