Thank you for considering contributing to Glueful! This guide will help you get started with the contribution process and provide you with the necessary information to make meaningful contributions to the project.

## Project Architecture Overview

Glueful is a modern PHP API framework with a modular architecture that consists of multiple repositories:

- **[glueful/glueful](https://github.com/glueful/glueful.git)** - Main PHP framework
- **[glueful/admin](https://github.com/glueful/admin.git)** - Admin UI (Vue 3)
- **[glueful/docs](https://github.com/glueful/docs.git)** - Documentation

## Prerequisites

Before you begin contributing, make sure you have:

- **PHP 8.2+** for framework development
- **MySQL 5.7+** or **PostgreSQL 12+** for database
- **Node.js 16+** and **pnpm** for Admin UI and Docs development
- **Git** for version control
- **Composer** for PHP package management
- Basic understanding of the framework's architecture and components

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Main Framework Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/glueful/glueful.git
cd glueful

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Set up database
php glueful db:migrate
```

### Admin UI Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/glueful/admin.git
cd admin

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment
cp public/env.json.example public/env.json
# Edit env.json with your configuration

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Documentation Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/glueful/docs.git
cd docs

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## Contribution Workflow

We follow a standard fork and pull request workflow:

### 1. Fork and Clone

1. Fork the appropriate repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   ```
3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/glueful/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   ```

### 2. Branch

Create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring with no functionality changes
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests

### 3. Develop

Make your changes following our coding standards (see below).

### 4. Test

Ensure your changes meet our testing requirements:

- For PHP code: `composer test`
- For Vue code: `pnpm test`

### 5. Commit

Follow these commit message guidelines:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests in the description

We follow conventional commit format:
- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Changes that don't affect code functionality (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Changes to build process, etc.

### 6. Push and Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Open a pull request from your fork to the original repository
3. Fill out the PR template with all required information

## Coding Standards

### PHP Code (Main Framework)

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use type declarations for parameters and return types
- Document all public methods with PHPDoc comments
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Avoid global state and static methods

### Vue/TypeScript Code (Admin UI)

- Follow the Vue Style Guide (Priority A and B rules)
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Prefer Composition API over Options API
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use kebab-case for custom element names

### General Guidelines

- Keep functions/methods small and focused
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable/function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Follow SOLID principles for OOP code

## Extension Development

Extensions are a key part of the Glueful ecosystem. Follow these guidelines when developing extensions:

### Extension Structure

Extensions follow a standardized directory structure:

```
glueful/
├── extensions/                 # Main extensions directory
│   ├── ExtensionName/          # Individual extension directory (PascalCase)
│   │   ├── ExtensionName.php   # Main extension class (same name as folder)
│   │   ├── config.php          # Extension configuration
│   │   ├── routes.php          # Extension routes
│   │   ├── README.md           # Documentation
│   │   ├── migrations/         # Database migrations (if needed)
│   │   ├── Providers/          # Service providers
│   │   └── ...                 # Other extension files
│   └── ...
└── config/
    └── extensions.php          # Extension configuration
```

### Extension Development Workflow

1. Create a new extension:
   ```bash
   php glueful extensions create MyExtension
   ```

2. Develop your extension following our coding standards

3. Test your extension locally:
   ```bash
   php glueful extensions test MyExtension
   ```

4. Submit your extension to the extensions repository via pull request

## Documentation Contributions

Documentation improvements are highly valued. When contributing to the docs:

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples for all features
- Follow Markdown best practices
- Add diagrams for complex concepts
- Check for broken links and references

## Cross-Repository Changes

Some features may require changes across multiple repositories. In these cases:

1. Create a tracking issue in the main repository describing all required changes
2. Create separate PRs in each affected repository
3. Reference the tracking issue in each PR
4. Note dependencies between PRs in the description
