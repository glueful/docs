This guide explains how to submit pull requests (PRs) to the Glueful ecosystem and the review process that follows. Since Glueful consists of multiple repositories, we've established specific workflows for both single-repository and cross-repository changes.

## Glueful Repository Structure

Remember that Glueful consists of multiple repositories:

- **[glueful/glueful](https://github.com/glueful/glueful.git)** - Main PHP framework
- **[glueful/admin](https://github.com/glueful/admin.git)** - Admin UI (Vue 3)
- **[glueful/docs](https://github.com/glueful/docs.git)** - Documentation

Your PR should target the appropriate repository for your changes.

## Creating a Pull Request

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicating effort
2. For major changes, consider discussing your idea via an issue first
3. Make sure your fork is up to date with the main repository:

   ```bash
   # Ensure you have the upstream remote added
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/glueful/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   
   # Fetch latest changes
   git fetch upstream
   
   # Ensure you're on your main branch
   git checkout main
   
   # Merge upstream changes
   git merge upstream/main
   
   # Push to your fork
   git push origin main
   ```

### Branch Naming Convention

Name your branch according to what it does:

- `feature/short-description` - For new features
- `fix/short-description` - For bug fixes
- `docs/short-description` - For documentation changes
- `refactor/short-description` - For code refactoring
- `test/short-description` - For adding or updating tests
- `chore/short-description` - For maintenance tasks

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch from `main` (or current development branch)

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them following our [Code Standards](/community/code-standards) and conventional commit format:

   ```bash
   # Example commit
   git commit -m "feat(auth): implement multi-factor authentication"
   ```

3. Push your branch to your fork

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Go to the original Glueful repository on GitHub and create a new pull request

5. Fill in the PR template with:
   - A clear title describing the change (following conventional commits format)
   - A detailed description of what the PR does
   - Any related issues (use keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #456")
   - Screenshots or GIFs for UI changes
   - Checklist of changes (tests added, documentation updated, etc.)
   - Any notable considerations for reviewers

## Pull Request Guidelines

### General Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single topic to make review easier
- Include tests for new features or bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Update documentation if your changes affect it
- Add or update code comments as needed
- Make sure your code follows Glueful's [coding standards](/community/code-standards)

### Repository-Specific Guidelines

#### Main Framework PRs (glueful/glueful)

- Ensure all PHP tests pass: `composer test`
- Check for backwards compatibility concerns
- Consider database migration impacts
- Document API changes

#### Admin UI PRs (glueful/admin)

- Ensure all Vue tests pass: `pnpm test`
- Verify responsive design works on different screen sizes
- Check for accessibility compliance
- Include screenshots of UI changes

#### Documentation PRs (glueful/docs)

- Preview changes locally with `pnpm dev`
- Check for broken links
- Ensure code examples are correct and up-to-date
- Follow the documentation style guide

## Cross-Repository Changes

Some features may require changes across multiple repositories. For these cases, follow this workflow:

1. Create a tracking issue in the main repository (glueful/glueful) describing all required changes
2. Create separate PRs in each affected repository
3. Reference the tracking issue in each PR
4. Note dependencies between PRs in the description

Example workflow for a feature requiring changes to both main framework and admin UI:

1. Open tracking issue in glueful/glueful (e.g., "Issue #123: Implement user analytics")
2. Create backend implementation and submit PR to glueful/glueful
   - Reference in PR description: "Part of glueful/glueful#123"
3. Create frontend implementation and submit PR to glueful/admin
   - Reference in PR description: "Part of glueful/glueful#123"
   - Note dependency: "Requires glueful/glueful#456 to be merged first"
4. After review, changes will be coordinated for simultaneous merge

## Pull Request Review Process

1. Automated checks run when you submit a PR:
   - CodeQL security scan
   - PHPUnit tests (PHP code)
   - Vitest tests (Vue code)
   - Linting and code style checks
   - Build validation

2. Maintainers will review your PR as soon as possible, looking for:
   - Code quality and adherence to standards
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation
   - Performance considerations
   - Security implications

3. If changes are needed, reviewers will add comments

4. Address review feedback by:
   - Making requested changes
   - Pushing additional commits to the same branch (PR updates automatically)
   - Responding to specific comments for discussion
   - Marking resolved comments once addressed

5. Once your PR has:
   - Passing automated checks
   - Required number of approvals (typically 1-2 depending on scope)
   - No outstanding change requests
   
   A maintainer will merge it using the squash and merge strategy.

### Review Response Guidelines

When addressing review feedback:

- Respond promptly to keep the PR moving forward
- Be open to constructive criticism; it's about improving the code
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- If you disagree with feedback, explain your reasoning respectfully
- For complex discussions, consider a video call instead of lengthy comment threads

## After Your PR is Merged

1. Delete your feature branch

   ```bash
   # Locally
   git checkout main
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
   
   # Remote (if desired)
   git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Update your local main branch

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

3. Your contribution will be:
   - Included in the next release
   - Added to the CHANGELOG.md (for significant changes)
   - Potentially highlighted in release notes

4. Consider helping review other PRs to learn more about the codebase

## Troubleshooting PR Issues

### Failed Automated Checks

If your PR fails automated checks:
1. Click on the failed check for details
2. Fix the issues locally
3. Push the fixes to your branch
4. The checks will automatically run again

### Merge Conflicts

If your PR develops merge conflicts:
1. Merge the target branch into your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   # Resolve conflicts
   git add .
   git commit -m "Merge main into feature branch"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Stale PRs

PRs with no activity for 14 days may be marked as stale. To revive a stale PR:
1. Make a new commit or comment on the PR
2. Address any outstanding feedback
3. Rebase if necessary to resolve conflicts
