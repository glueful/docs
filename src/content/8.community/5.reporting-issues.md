Effective issue reporting helps the Glueful team understand, reproduce, and fix problems efficiently. This guide explains how to create useful issue reports for the Glueful ecosystem.

## Determining Where to Report

Glueful consists of multiple repositories, and issues should be reported in the appropriate one:

- **[glueful/glueful](https://github.com/glueful/glueful/issues)**: Core framework issues (PHP API, database, authentication, etc.)
- **[glueful/admin](https://github.com/glueful/admin/issues)**: Admin UI issues (Vue components, dashboard features, etc.)
- **[glueful/docs](https://github.com/glueful/docs/issues)**: Documentation issues (errors, unclear content, missing information)

If you're unsure where to report, start with the main [glueful/glueful](https://github.com/glueful/glueful/issues) repository, and the maintainers can help redirect if necessary.

## Before Reporting an Issue

Before creating a new issue:

1. **Search existing issues**: Check if the issue has already been reported
2. **Update to the latest version**: Ensure you're using the latest version of Glueful
3. **Clear cache and temporary files**: Many issues can be resolved by clearing caches
4. **Check documentation**: Ensure the behavior is actually a bug, not an intended feature
5. **Isolate the problem**: Try to identify which component is causing the issue

## Issue Types

### Bug Reports

Use for unexpected behavior, errors, or crashes.

**Required Information**:

- **Glueful Version**: The exact version you're using
- **PHP Version**: Your PHP version (e.g., 8.2.10)
- **Environment**: Development, testing, production
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL version
- **Operating System**: What OS and version you're using
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed step-by-step instructions
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
- **Error Messages**: Full error output, including stack traces
- **Screenshots/Videos**: Visual evidence when applicable
- **Code Samples**: Minimal code examples demonstrating the issue

**Example Bug Report Format**:

```md
## Bug Description
When creating a new user via the API, the system returns a 500 error if the email contains special characters.

## Environment
- Glueful Version: 1.2.3
- PHP Version: 8.2.10
- Environment: Development
- Database: MySQL 8.0
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Make a POST request to `/api/users`
2. Include an email with a plus sign: `test+123@example.com`
3. Send the request

## Expected Behavior
User should be created successfully with status code 201

## Actual Behavior
Server returns 500 error with message "Invalid email format"

## Error Log
```
[2025-05-08 10:23:45] glueful.ERROR: Invalid email format {"email":"test+123@example.com"} 
Stack trace: ...
```

## Screenshots

```

### Feature Requests

Use when suggesting new functionality or improvements.

**Required Information**:

- **Feature Summary**: A clear, concise description
- **Problem**: What problem this feature would solve
- **Proposed Solution**: Your idea for implementing the feature
- **Alternatives**: Other solutions or features you've considered
- **Context**: Why this feature would be useful to most Glueful users
- **Examples**: Examples from other similar software, if applicable

**Example Feature Request Format**:

```md
## Feature Summary
Add support for TOTP-based two-factor authentication

## Problem
Currently, Glueful only supports single-factor authentication, which is insufficient for applications requiring higher security.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) system that:
- Allows users to enable 2FA in their profile
- Provides QR codes for authenticator apps
- Handles backup codes
- Verifies 2FA codes during login

## Alternatives
- SMS-based 2FA (rejected due to SIM swap vulnerabilities)
- Email-based 2FA (less secure and convenient)

## Context
This would benefit applications handling sensitive data that require PCI, HIPAA, or GDPR compliance.

## Examples
- Laravel Fortify handles 2FA in a similar way
- Auth0 provides a similar implementation
```

### Documentation Issues

Use for errors, unclear explanations, or missing information in the documentation.

**Required Information**:

- **Page URL**: Link to the affected documentation page
- **Issue Description**: What's incorrect or missing
- **Suggested Fix**: How the documentation could be improved
- **Screenshots**: If applicable

### Security Vulnerabilities

**Do not report security vulnerabilities as public issues!**

Instead, send an email to security@glueful.com with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigations

## How to Submit an Issue

1. Go to the appropriate repository's Issues page
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select the appropriate issue template
4. Fill in all required fields with detailed information
5. Add labels if you have permission (otherwise, maintainers will add them)
6. Submit the issue

## Issue Lifecycle

After submission, issues typically follow this process:

1. **Triage**: Maintainers verify, label, and prioritize the issue
2. **Discussion**: Team members may ask questions or request more information
3. **Assignment**: The issue is assigned to a developer
4. **Resolution**: The issue is fixed or a decision is made not to fix
5. **Verification**: For bugs, the fix is verified and tested
6. **Closure**: The issue is closed when resolved

## Issue Labels

Glueful uses the following primary labels:

- `bug`: Confirmed bugs and errors
- `enhancement`: Feature requests and improvements
- `documentation`: Documentation-related issues
- `help wanted`: Issues where community help is particularly welcome
- `good first issue`: Good issues for newcomers to the project
- `security`: Security-related issues (visible only after patched)
- `duplicate`: Issues already reported elsewhere
- `wontfix`: Issues that won't be addressed (with explanation)

## Best Practices

### Do:
- Be specific and detailed
- Include reproducible examples
- Respond promptly to questions about your issue
- Update the issue if you find new information
- Close issues if you solve them yourself

### Don't:
- Report multiple unrelated problems in a single issue
- Use issues for general support questions (use the forum or Discord instead)
- Reopen closed issues (create a new one if the problem reappears)
- Add "+1" comments (use GitHub reactions instead)
