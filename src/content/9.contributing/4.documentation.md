# Contributing to Documentation

Good documentation is essential for any framework. This guide explains how to contribute to Glueful's documentation.

## Documentation Structure

The Glueful documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. **Getting Started**: Introduction and installation guides
2. **Essentials**: Core concepts and basic usage
3. **Core Features**: Detailed guides on main features
4. **Advanced Features**: More complex usage patterns
5. **Extensions**: Information about extending the framework
6. **Administration**: Admin panel usage and customization
7. **API Reference**: Detailed API documentation
8. **Deployment**: Guides for deploying Glueful applications
9. **Contributing**: How to contribute to the project (this section)

## Writing Style Guidelines

When contributing to the documentation, please follow these style guidelines:

- Use clear, concise language
- Write in present tense
- Use active voice when possible
- Be inclusive and accessible
- Include code examples when relevant
- Use headers to organize content
- Link to related documentation

## Adding New Documentation

### File Structure

Documentation files are Markdown files (`.md`) located in the `/docs/src/content/` directory. Each section has its own numbered directory, and files within the directory are also numbered.

### Front Matter

Each documentation page should include front matter at the top of the file if needed:

```md
---
title: Page Title
description: Brief description of the page content
---

# Page Title

Content goes here...
```

### Navigation

The navigation for each section is defined in a `.navigation.yml` file in the section directory:

```yaml
title: Section Title
description: Section description
icon: i-heroicons-icon-name
links:
  - label: Page Title
    to: /section/page-slug
```

## Documentation Formatting

### Markdown Features

The documentation uses Markdown with some enhanced features:

#### Code Blocks

Use triple backticks with a language specifier:

```vue
<template>
  <div>Example Vue component</div>
</template>
```

#### Callouts

Use blockquotes with special prefixes:

```md
::: info
This is an info box
:::

::: warning
This is a warning
:::

::: danger
This is a danger/error message
:::
```

#### Tables

Use standard Markdown tables:

```md
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

## Testing Documentation Changes

After making changes to the documentation, you should:

1. Run the documentation site locally to verify your changes

   ```bash
   cd docs
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Check for broken links and formatting issues
3. Ensure your content appears correctly in the navigation
4. Verify that code examples work as expected

## Submitting Documentation Changes

Follow the same [Pull Request process](/contributing/pull-requests) as code contributions, with these additional guidelines:

1. For small fixes (typos, clarifications), you can submit a PR directly
2. For larger changes (new pages, restructuring), create an issue first to discuss
3. Use the branch prefix `docs/` for documentation changes

## Translation Contributions

If you're interested in translating the Glueful documentation to other languages, please contact the core team to discuss the process and requirements.
