# Code Standards

Maintaining a consistent code style across the Glueful framework helps make the code more readable and maintainable. This guide outlines the coding standards we follow for PHP.

## PHP Coding Standards

Glueful's PHP codebase follows PSR standards:

- **PSR-1**: Basic Coding Standard
- **PSR-2/PSR-12**: Coding Style Guide
- **PSR-4**: Autoloading Standard

### Key PHP Guidelines

- Use 4 spaces for indentation, not tabs
- PHP files MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM
- Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`
- Method names MUST be declared in `camelCase`
- Class constants MUST be declared in all uppercase with underscore separators

### PHP Code Formatting

We recommend using PHP_CodeSniffer for code style checking:

```bash
# Install PHP_CodeSniffer
composer require --dev squizlabs/php_codesniffer

# Check code style
./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=PSR12 api/
```

## Documenting Code

All code should be properly documented:

- Use PHPDoc comments for classes, methods, and functions
- Include descriptions for parameters, return values, and exceptions

## Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

Example:

```
feat: add user authentication endpoint

Implements JWT-based authentication for API users
Closes #123
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

We recommend setting up pre-commit hooks to ensure your code meets our standards before committing.
