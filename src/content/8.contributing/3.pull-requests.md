# Pull Requests

This guide explains how to submit a pull request (PR) to Glueful and the review process that follows.

## Creating a Pull Request

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicating effort
2. For major changes, consider discussing your idea via an issue first
3. Make sure your fork is up to date with the main repository

### Branch Naming Convention

Name your branch according to what it does:

- `feature/short-description` - For new features
- `fix/short-description` - For bug fixes
- `docs/short-description` - For documentation changes
- `refactor/short-description` - For code refactoring

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch from `main` (or current development branch)

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them following our [Code Standards](/contributing/code-standards)

3. Push your branch to your fork

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Go to the original Glueful repository on GitHub and create a new pull request

5. Fill in the PR template with:
   - A clear title describing the change
   - A detailed description of what the PR does
   - Any related issues (use keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #456")
   - Screenshots or GIFs for UI changes

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single topic to make review easier
- Include tests for new features or bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Update documentation if your changes affect it
- Add or update code comments as needed

## Pull Request Review Process

1. Maintainers will review your PR as soon as possible
2. Automated tests will run to verify your changes
3. Reviewers might request changes or clarification
4. Address review comments by adding new commits
5. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

### Review Feedback

When addressing review feedback:

- Don't take criticism personally; it's about improving the code
- Ask questions if you don't understand a suggestion
- If you disagree with feedback, explain your reasoning
- Make requested changes promptly to keep the PR moving forward

## After Your PR is Merged

1. Delete your feature branch

   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Update your local main branch

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

3. Consider helping review other PRs to learn more about the codebase
