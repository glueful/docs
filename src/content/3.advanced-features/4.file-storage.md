Glueful provides a flexible and secure file storage system that supports both local filesystem storage and cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. The file storage system handles file uploads, retrieval, processing, and security.

## Overview

The file storage system in Glueful:

- Supports multiple storage drivers (local filesystem, Amazon S3)
- Provides secure file upload handling with validation
- Offers both multipart form uploads and base64 encoded uploads
- Implements secure file naming and path management
- Includes image processing and optimization capabilities
- Supports signed URLs for secure temporary access
- Integrates with the permissions system

## How File Storage Works

The Glueful file storage system uses a driver-based approach through the `StorageInterface`. When an upload is processed:

1. The file is validated for security and content type
2. A secure filename is generated
3. The file is moved to the appropriate storage via the selected driver
4. Metadata is stored in the database
5. A public URL or secure access method is returned

## Configuration

File storage is configured in your application's `config/storage.php` file.

### Basic Configuration Options

```php
return [
    // Default storage driver (local, s3)
    'driver' => env('STORAGE_DRIVER', 'local'),
    
    // Local storage configuration
    'local' => [
        'uploads_dir' => env('UPLOADS_DIR', 'storage/uploads'),
        'public_url' => env('FILES_PUBLIC_URL', '/uploads'),
    ],
    
    // S3 storage configuration
    's3' => [
        'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
        'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
        'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION', 'us-east-1'),
        'bucket' => env('AWS_BUCKET'),
        'endpoint' => env('AWS_ENDPOINT'), // Optional for S3-compatible services
    ],
    
    // Allowed file types and size limits
    'allowed_types' => [
        'image/jpeg',
        'image/png',
        'image/gif',
        'application/pdf',
        // Add more types as needed
    ],
    'max_file_size' => env('MAX_FILE_SIZE', 10485760), // 10MB default
];
```

## Basic Usage

### Uploading Files

```php
use Glueful\Helpers\FileHandler;

$fileHandler = new FileHandler();

// Handle form-based file upload
$result = $fileHandler->handleFileUpload($_GET, $_FILES);

if ($result['success']) {
    $fileUrl = $result['data']['url'];
    $fileUuid = $result['data']['uuid'];
    // Handle successful upload
} else {
    $errorMessage = $result['message'];
    // Handle error
}
```

### Uploading Base64 Encoded Files

```php
use Glueful\Helpers\FileHandler;

$fileHandler = new FileHandler();

// Handle base64 file upload
$result = $fileHandler->handleBase64Upload(
    ['name' => 'myimage.jpg', 'mime_type' => 'image/jpeg'],
    ['base64' => $base64String]
);

if ($result['success']) {
    $fileUrl = $result['data']['url'];
    // Process successful upload
}
```

### Retrieving Files

```php
use Glueful\Helpers\FileHandler;

$fileHandler = new FileHandler();
$fileInfo = $fileHandler->getFile($uuid, 'info');

// Get file information
$fileMetadata = $fileInfo['data'];

// Download a file
$fileHandler->getFile($uuid, 'download');

// Display a file inline
$fileHandler->getFile($uuid, 'inline');
```

## Storage Drivers

Glueful supports multiple storage drivers through the `StorageInterface`. Each driver implements methods for storing, retrieving, checking existence, and deleting files.

### Local Storage Driver

The `LocalStorage` driver stores files in the local filesystem and serves them through a web-accessible URL.

```php
use Glueful\Uploader\Storage\LocalStorage;

$storage = new LocalStorage(
    config('paths.uploads'),
    config('paths.cdn')
);

// Store a file
$path = $storage->store('/tmp/myfile.jpg', 'images/myfile.jpg');

// Get the public URL
$url = $storage->getUrl('images/myfile.jpg');
```

### Amazon S3 Storage Driver

The `S3Storage` driver stores files in Amazon S3 compatible storage services.

```php
use Glueful\Uploader\Storage\S3Storage;

$storage = new S3Storage();

// Store a file in S3
$path = $storage->store('/tmp/myfile.jpg', 'images/myfile.jpg');

// Get the public URL
$url = $storage->getUrl('images/myfile.jpg');

// Generate a signed URL for temporary access (5 minutes)
$signedUrl = $storage->getSignedUrl('images/myfile.jpg', 300);
```

## Image Processing

Glueful includes image processing capabilities for resizing, cropping, and optimizing images:

```php
use Glueful\Helpers\FileHandler;

$fileHandler = new FileHandler();

// Get an image with processing
$result = $fileHandler->getFile($uuid, 'image', [
    'w' => 300,    // Width in pixels
    'h' => 200,    // Height in pixels
    'q' => 85,     // Quality (1-100)
]);

// Get the processed image URL
$imageUrl = $result['data']['url'];
```

## API Endpoints

Glueful provides RESTful API endpoints for file operations:

### Uploading Files

```
POST /files

// Multipart form data upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
...file data...

// OR Base64 encoded upload
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "base64": "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
  "name": "myimage.jpg",
  "mime_type": "image/jpeg"
}
```

### Retrieving Files

```
GET /files/{uuid}?type=info|download|inline|image
```

For images, additional parameters are available:

```
GET /files/{uuid}?type=image&w=300&h=200&q=85
```

## Security Features

Glueful's file storage system implements several security features:

1. **File type validation** - Only allowed MIME types are accepted
2. **Content scanning** - Files are checked for potentially malicious content
3. **Secure random filenames** - Original filenames are not used in storage
4. **Signed URLs** - For private files that need temporary access
5. **Permission integration** - Files can be restricted based on user permissions

## Best Practices

1. **Use environment variables** for storage configuration to keep credentials secure
2. **Implement appropriate permissions** to control who can upload and access files
3. **Enable CORS headers** when using S3 storage with frontend uploads
4. **Set reasonable file size limits** to prevent abuse
5. **Use image processing** to optimize images for web display
6. **Enable CDN integration** for high-traffic applications
7. **Implement file cleanup processes** to remove temporary and orphaned files
8. **Use signed URLs** for sensitive documents rather than public URLs
9. **Consider implementing virus scanning** for uploaded files in high-security environments
10. **Backup your file storage** regularly

## CLI Commands

The Glueful CLI provides commands for managing files:

```bash
# List recent uploads
php glueful files:list

# Delete a file by UUID
php glueful files:delete <uuid>

# Clean up temporary files
php glueful files:cleanup
```

## Technical Details

The storage system uses these key components:

- `StorageInterface` - Defines the contract for all storage drivers
- `LocalStorage` - Implements storage on the local filesystem
- `S3Storage` - Implements storage on Amazon S3 compatible services
- `FileUploader` - Handles the upload process and security validation
- `FileHandler` - Provides high-level methods for file operations
